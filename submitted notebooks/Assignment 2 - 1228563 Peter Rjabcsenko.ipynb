    "#### Separate and Detect:\n",
    "perforemed surprisingly well with approx. 72% F-measure, using only hand-crafted methods.\n",
    "It should however be probably noted that the data used in this task contained very little noise and consisted only of 3 very distinct percussive instruments so filtering the bands very cleanly separated the instruments.\n",
    "This method would probably be much less effective on more generic data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Segment and Classify:\n",
    "performed similarly to the above approach and it was very interesting to see that a simple KNN model could be used to identify the instruments. Its advantages being the practical abscence of training time, the relative ease of interpretation of the model and the fact that usually less data is needed for it to perform reasonably compared to a NN. This approach would probably fair better in the general case compared to Separate and Detect if given enough quality training data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NMF:\n",
    "The semi adaptive NMF performed the best out of the NMF methods with around 69% F-measure, being closest to the performance of the template initialized NMF (maybe this could be attributed to the choice of beta, which brought it closer to the template NMF rather than to the fixed base NMF in terms of performance). It was interesting to see that the fixed based NMF performed rather poorly, so its seem crucial to give a little room for the base to adjust one way or another.\n",
    "The NMFs performed similarly to the above methods in this case but I would assume that it would perform much better on unseen data due to its adaptability compared to the other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CNF:\n",
    "CNF is probably the most effective method, but due to my poor PyTorch knowledge I have undoubtedly made several mistakes during the implementation, hence the very low score of 28%\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of runtime, the 3 methods above performed more or less the same, with NMF taking marginally longer.\n",
    "The training phase of the CNN however takes significantly longer, which is to be expected from those kinds of models"
